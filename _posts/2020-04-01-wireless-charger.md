Here's a wireless charging pad I put together. It's made of oak with a walnut base and aluminum inlay styled to look like a tree trunk. I particulairly like the contrast between the sharp, geometric sides and the organic tree ring inlay.

This whole project was designed in Onshape, and I used Fusion 360 to generate toolpaths and create renders. Everything was cut out on a Shapeoko 3, glued together, and finished by hand. Check out this tutorial on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/CNC-Wireless-Charger/) to see the whole process.
